Day-1: 	# Sieve of eratosthenes
	# fast modular exponentiation
	# pigeonhole principle - need more in depth idea 

Day-2:	# partial sum
	# maximum sum subarry
	# longest consecutive number subarray
	  
	
DAY-3 : # Binary Search

DAY-4 : # Added some DS codes to the repo -> linked list, stack, queue
	# Euler's Totient
	# Segmented sieve
	# modular inverse

DAY-5	# Gauss Jordan Elimination 
DAY-6	# permuation using recursion
